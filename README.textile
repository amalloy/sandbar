h1. Sandbar

Sandbar is a web application library built on top of Compojure. It
contains code to help with: 

* scaling server side state
* tables which may be filtered, sorted and paged
* form layout, validation and error reporting
* authorization and authentication
* user management

The project contains the library code as well a reference project
which uses the library.

This is the very beginning of this project. Things will change rapidly
and be ugly for a while. Input is welcome.

h2. Overview and motivation

The goal of this project is to create a library that will allow
Clojure developers to create useful web applications with the minimum
amount of code. I want to see how small the minimum can be.

There will be no code generation or templates, this is not a
framework. You will write all of code that exists in your project
using the full power of Clojure. Everything else will be in a reusable 
library. You will also not have to use everything. You may use only
the parts you like and forget the rest.

h2. Running the reference project

The reference project is an idea database which demonstrates how to
use the sandbar libraries.

The reference application currently works with MySQL.

Follow these steps to run the web app:

# Install Leiningen
# Clone this repository
# Use lein deps to get the project dependencies
# Create a MySQL database named idea_db
# Create a MySQL user named idea_user@localhost with password 123456789
# Start a repl with lein repl
# (load-file "src/sandbar/example/ideadb/config.clj")
# (create-tables)
# (load-file "src/sandbar/user_tables_mysql.clj")
# (create-tables)
# (load-file "src/sandbar/example/ideadb/app_development.clj")

TODO: Test and simplify the above steps

h3. Authentication and Authorization

* Use SHA-256 and use Compojure's security functions.
* Improve error handling when something goes wrong at the db level. Catch exceptions and display error messages.
* Should be able to configure a default login redirect page.
