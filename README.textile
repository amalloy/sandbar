h1. Sandbar

Sandbar is a library for web applications built on top of Compojure. It contains code to help with: 

* scaling server side state
* tables which may be filtered, sorted and paged
* form layout, validation and error reporting
* authorization and authentication
* user management

The project contains the library code as well a reference application which uses the library.

h2. Overview and motivation

The goal of this project is to create a library that will allow Clojure developers to create useful web applications with the minimum amount of code. I want to see how small the minimum can be.

h2. Running the reference project

The reference application demonstrates how to use the sandbar libraries.

TODO: more detail

To run the reference application, follow these steps:

# Install Leiningen
# Clone this repository
# Use lein deps to get the project dependencies
# Create a MySQL database named idea_db
# Create a MySQL user named idea_user@localhost with password 123456789
# Start a repl with lein repl
# (load-file "src/sandbar/example/ideadb/config.clj")
# (create-tables)
# (load-file "src/sandbar/user_tables_mysql.clj")
# (create-tables)
# (load-file "src/sandbar/example/ideadb/app_development.clj")

TODO: Test and simplify the above steps

h2. Road map

This is the very beginning of this project. Things will change rapidly and be ugly for a while. Input is welcome.

h3. Authentication and Authorization

* Use SHA-256 and use Compojure's security functions.
* Improve error handling when something goes wrong at the db level. Catch exceptions and display error messages.
* Should be able to configure a default login redirect page.
