# Sandbar

Sandbar is a web application library built on top of Compojure. It contains code to help with: 

* authorization and authentication
* user management
* tables which may be filtered, sorted and paged
* form layout, validation and error reporting
* scaling server side state

The project contains the library code as well as an example project which uses the library. I hope
that including an example project will make it easy to see how thing are used and to experiment as
I move forward. The included tests also serve as examples.
