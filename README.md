# Sandbar

Sandbar is a web application library built on top of Compojure. It contains code to help with: 

* authorization and authentication
* user management
* tables which may be filtered, sorted and paged
* form layout, validation and error reporting
* scaling server side state

The project contains the library code as well as an example project which uses the library. 
I hope that including an example project will make it easy to see how to use the library as 
well as giving you a chance to play with working code. The included tests also serve as 
examples.
