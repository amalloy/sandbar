"...if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in my heart to bestow it all on your worship." Dogberry, Much Ado about Nothing

Working with forms in html can be tedious. You design and layout a form, submit it, validate inputs, display errors and then give the user some feedback. Sandbar is going to try to make all of this easier for 90% of your form use cases. The beauty is you can use it when you want and do it yourself the rest of the time.

Here are the things that I would like to implement/test/highlight in this document, in no particular order:

h3. To be implemented and tested

* Show examples of all kinds of form fields including selects, multi selects and text areas
* Providing default field values
* Specify the key to use for the id
* Show how to create custom controls

h3. Tested and ready for examples and documentation

* Gradually building forms always having them work, there are sane defaults to all options
* Field layouts
* Validation
* Show how to integrate with jQuery
* Adding attributes to a field
* Page layout
* Provide your own form layout
* Provide your own buttons (this needs to be internationalized)
* Internationalization
