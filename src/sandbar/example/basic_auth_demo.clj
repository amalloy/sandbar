;; Building on the auth-demo code, adding form based
;; authentication. Please check out that demo first in order to
;; understand the basics of authentication. We are re-using the model
;; and view code from that example here. Notes are included.

;;
;; Properties
;; ==========
;; A map is used to configure the text that is displayed on the
;; login form as well as configuring the error messages that are
;; displayed. This is optional, there are sane defaults.

(def properties
     {:username "Username (admin or member)"
      :password "Password (same as above)"
      :username-validation-error "Enter either admin or member"
      :password-validation-error "Enter a password!"})

;;
;; Implement BasicAuthAdapter
;; ==========================
;;

(defrecord DemoAdapter []
  BasicAuthAdapter
  (load-user
   [this username password]
   (let [login {:username username :password password}]
     (cond (= username "member")
           (merge login {:roles #{:member}})

       (add-validation-error m "Incorrect username or password!")))))

  (merge (DemoAdapter.) properties))

;;
;; Routes
;; ======
;; We add basic-auth-routes to get the login form, passing it our
;; layout, properties and the UserModel. We also create a route
;; for the permission-denied page which is where the user will be
;; redirected when they attempt to visit a page that they do not have
;; permission to view.

(defroutes my-routes
  (GET "/home*" [] (layout (home-view)))
  (GET "/member*" [] (layout (member-view)))
  (GET "/admin*" [] (layout (admin-view)))
  (GET "/permission-denied*" [] (layout (permission-denied-view)))
  (basic-auth-routes (fn [r c] (layout c))
                     (basic-auth-adapter))
  (ANY "*" [] (layout (home-view))))

;;
;; Configure Channel Security
;; ==========================
;; This will ensure that the login page is encrypted and all other
;; pages are not. We add a special config for resources so that we
;; don't get mixed content on secure pages.

(def security-config
     [#"/login.*"                   :ssl 
      #".*.css|.*.js|.*.png|.*.gif" :any-channel 
      #".*"                         :nossl])

;;
;; Add the with-security middleware to enable authorization and
;; authentication passing it the basic-auth authorization function. We
;; also add middleware for channel security.

     (-> my-routes
         (with-security basic-auth)
